&lt;p&gt;Dispatches from the Great Burning: What My Mennonite Ancestors and the Gobi Bear Taught Me About Surviving the Climate Emergency by Helen Stoltzfus&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does it mean to be a worthy ancestor – or a worthy human being – in a time of catastrophic upheaval? What does it mean to act audaciously – without knowing the outcome of one’s actions? One woman, six dispatches from: The Gobi Desert of Mongolia. The Big Bang. The Civil War. Oakland. The Alaskan tundra. Paradise…and its fires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;All Dates and Times&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Secrets of the Trees by Caitlyn Kilgore, featuring Stephanie Chen, Bobbi Dulaney, Carrie Gaydos, and Mel Mark&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the book The Hidden Life of Trees by Peter Wohleben, this piece blossomed into an affirmation of our interdependence. Drawing inspiration from Standing Rock and other political actions, and books like Blessed Unrest and Radical Ecology, the performers have woven together a story of struggle and hope in a harrowing time. Touching on themes of socialism, competition, set-back, and rebirth, The Secrets of the Trees is a circus, dance, and theatrical critique of capitalism and greed told through the eyes of the forest as they struggle for survival in the Anthropocene.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Sunday March 8th 4p and 8p, and Sunday March 15th 7p Dispatches from the Great Burning: What My Mennonite Ancestors and the Gobi Bear Taught Me About Surviving the Climate Emergency by Helen Stoltzfus What does it mean to be a worthy ancestor – or a worthy human being – in a time of catastrophic upheaval?

Siren's Last Song by Ebb/Flow Collective&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ocean herself brings an oil-slicked message with the tide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rainbow plastics fill the siren’s tail as he swims a somber finale, alone in a foreign place he once called home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The siren’s last song, a distant memory –the Ocean embraces him as he drifts into eternal sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
