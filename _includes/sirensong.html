Siren's Last Song by Ebb/Flow Collective</h4>

The Ocean herself brings an oil-slicked message with the tide.

Rainbow plastics fill the siren’s tail as he swims a somber finale, alone in a foreign place he once called home.

The siren’s last song, a distant memory –the Ocean embraces him as he drifts into eternal sleep.
