<center><h3>The Secrets Of The Trees</h3></center>

<h4>All Dates and Times</h4>

Inspired by the book The Hidden Life of Trees by Peter Wohleben, this piece blossomed into an affirmation of our interdependence. Drawing inspiration from Standing Rock and other political actions, and books like Blessed Unrest and Radical Ecology, the performers have woven together a story of struggle and hope in a harrowing time. Touching on themes of socialism, competition, set-back, and rebirth, The Secrets of the Trees is a circus, dance, and theatrical critique of capitalism and greed told through the eyes of the forest as they struggle for survival in the Anthropocene.

<b>Performer Bios:</b>
<u>Caitlyn Kilgore</u> has been a movement enthusiast all her life, which means she was a handful growing up.  After somehow surviving her desire to rollerskate down the backyard slide, she has sought out an impressive movement vocabulary.  She started training circus arts at Athletic Playground 10 years ago.  She is a dedicated and inspiring teacher for adults and children around the world.  Over the past 7 years she has taught regular classes at many spaces in the East Bay including Athletic Playground, Kinetic Arts Center, and Kids n' Dance, as well as workshops in four different countries.  Ever since her first circus show in BUST Women’s Circus with WiseFool New Mexico in  2010, Caitlyn has been honing her craft and performing around the Bay Area.  She is so delighted to bring to the stage this updated version of her passion project and has so many people to thank for their support in making it happen.  @bootscats_bootscats_

<u>Bobbi Dulaney</u> began performing in theater, choir and dance at age 7.  Her infatuation with circus arts began at age 18 with acrobatic Hula Hoop and Aerial Arts a year later.  She has taught at Trapeze Arts and Athletic Playground as well as provided free circus arts education in Bay Area shelters through the nonprofit Living Dream Arts, where she is also the Executive Director.  She has performed with Living Dream Arts troupe Dreamtime Circus throughout the Bay Area and on tour across the US and Peru. From 2012-2016 Bobbi ran an independent circus arts agency called Inner Orbit Arts and provided her acts to private and corporate clients like Google, PayPal, Virgin and others alongside many talented local performers.  She has many people to thank for her creative growth including her mother Joelle Dulaney, Beverly Rose her first aerial instructor, all of her teachers and the staff at Athletic Playground, Chris Dunn founder of Dreamtime Circus, Tara Quinn who taught her how to value her art, Savannah Lees-Haley for her partnership in performance, and her husband Jeremy Gilbert for supporting her ambitions and running away with her to join the circus. She especially would like to thank her fellow performers and Caitlyn Kilgore for their hard work, creativity and dedication to this project.

<u>Carrie Gaydos</u>
From 1997 - 2007, Carrie trained and competed in the USA Gymnastics Elite Program and went on to expand her performance art through acrobatic gymnastics from 2007 - 2011. Discovering aerial dance at the age of 24, Carrie began her training in Northern Arizona - where, in 2014, she co-founded two-time Viola Award-winning aerial theatre company, Dark Sky Aerial. Specializing in harness dance and aerial fabric, Carrie has performed in airplane hangars, historic hotels, on the exterior walls of industrial buildings, and suspended from construction cranes. Throughout her time as an aerialist, Carrie has completed approximately one year of residency at the New England Center for Circus Arts and a two-month artist residency at Central del Circ in Barcelona. Her most notable performances include: A Christmas Carol, Connections (Powerhouse Science Center), Electric Kingdom, Hungry Hearts Cabaret, Illuminate Film Festival, Mural Mice: Sound of Flight, OPIA, Spark! Mesa Festival of the Arts, TILT, The Foundry, and Yard Dogs Road Show (The Documentary).  @darksky_aerial

<u>Stephanie Chen</u> is thrilled to be a part of this multidisciplinary ensemble show fighting for the trees. She grew up doing ballet (aka 1000s of Nutcracker performances) and competitive gymnastics (aka 1000s of times getting judged on form) before immersing herself in modern dance during her college years. She discovered circus in San Francisco and fell in love with aerial hoop while training with Chloe Axelrod and flying trapeze. Performing throughout the Bay Area on aerial hoop, aerial dance, and as a company member of Duniya Dance and Drum Company, she loves sharing her joy of movement through her playful style and spirit. She trains at the Circus Center, ODC, formerly Cayuga (☮), and graduated from Princeton University’s Theater and Dance program. Performance highlights in the Bay Area include the deYoung Museum, Zaccho Dance Theater, Danceground Keriac, JCC, Yerba Buena Gardens Festival, Asian Art Museum, Dance Mission Theater, SFPL, and CounterPulse. Stephanie thanks all of her families! @eighnjel
