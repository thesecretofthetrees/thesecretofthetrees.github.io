Huma(N)ature is a dance, theater, and circus production investigating humanity’s relationship to nature - our misguided dominion over it, our inordinate influence upon it, our continued reliance on its systems, and our place within it.  Showcasing a variety of artists and shows, Huma(N)ature will be a different experience nearly every night.  

The throughline each night will be The Secrets of the Trees, a circus and dance show inspired by the book The Hidden Life of Trees by Peter Wohleben.  This theatrical critique of capitalism and greed is told through the trees as they struggle for survival in the Anthropocene*.  Originally performed in June 2018 at Athletic Playground in Emeryville, Caitlyn Kilgore and her cast have been excitedly updating this deeply affective, dazzling acrobatic display for its Dance Mission reboot.

Other shows sharing the stage with The Secrets of the Trees vary from musicals to monologues to modern dance.  Created and performed by some of the Bay Area’s strongest activists and artist - including members of our local Extinction Rebellion (@XRSFBayArea) - each show will offer something unique, beautiful, and important for the times ahead.  Stay tuned for more info about each offering!

*The current, scientifically proposed geologic epoch in which human activities constitute a major impact on all Earth’s ecological processes.

<b>Things You Can Do For the Trees:</b>
<ul>
  <li>Reduce your carbon footprint by limiting energy use: bike, walk, and take public transit as much as you can; limit flights, turn off and unplug electronics that you’re not using, eat less meat (especially beef), eat less processed food, and hang clothes up to dry and/or use dryer balls.</li>
  <li>Make sure you’re buying paper products that come from recycled or sustainable souces and <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/media/2019/190220">do not destroy old growth forests in North America.</a> <img src="img/tp.png"></li>
  <li>Buy local: it helps reduce carbon emissions from shipping and packaging, plus you’re much more likely to be supporting a business that pays their employees a living wage and benefits (especially if you live in the Bay Area)... Businesses like <a href="https://newfoodeconomy.org/amazon-snap-employees-five-states/">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2013-11-13/how-mcdonald-s-and-wal-mart-became-welfare-queens">Wal-Mart, and McDonalds</a> are actually some of the biggest recipients of benefits from welfare programs as public programs foot the bill for their insufficient employee pay and benefits.</li>
  <li>Reduce your waste: bring your own coffee cup, opt out of plastic utensils when you order take-out, donate old clothes, buy used products whenever possible, keep your phone longer, compost and recycle, take advantage of places like Urban Ore and East Bay Depot for Creative Reuse.</li>
  <li>Plant some trees!</li>
  <li>Support some organizations, especially those that center indigenous and POC voices and experiences as those communities are often on the front lines of pollution and climate change - usually toxic facilities, refineries, and ports are put in areas with high populations of POC and low income families; often indigenous communities are working hard to keep forests and other wild places from being developed:
